# 🧹 Diploma Verification Project - Cleanup Plan

## Current Analysis
The project is already well-structured! Most components are functional and properly organized.

## Proposed Changes

### 🗑️ **Files to Remove** (Confirm before proceeding)
- [ ] `hash_tester/` directory - **Redundant** (functionality already in main frontend)
  - hash_tester/index.html (duplicates PDF hash generation)
  - hash_tester/README.md (outdated)

### 📝 **Files to Create/Update**
- [ ] `README.md` (main project README - missing)
- [ ] Update `docs/README.md` (if needed)
- [ ] Update `contracts/README.md` (if needed)
- [ ] Update `frontend/README.md` (if needed)

### 🔧 **Files to Modify**
- [ ] `frontend/src/index.html` - Update contract addresses section with clear instructions
- [ ] `.env.example` - Create template for environment variables

### ✅ **Files to Keep (Already Good)**
- ✅ `contracts/DiplomaRegistry.sol` - Excellent implementation
- ✅ `test/DiplomaRegistry.test.js` - Comprehensive tests  
- ✅ `ignition/modules/Deploy.js` - Clean deployment
- ✅ `hardhat.config.js` - Proper configuration
- ✅ `package.json` - Well-organized scripts

## Confirmation Required

**Please confirm the deletions by editing this file:**
- [ ] ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Delete `hash_tester/` directory (redundant)
- [ ] ❌ **KEEP**: Keep `hash_tester/` directory  

**After you confirm, I will:**
1. Remove confirmed files
2. Create comprehensive README files
3. Update all documentation with current instructions
4. Add MetaMask connection guide for both networks
5. Ensure all paths and addresses are properly documented

## Notes
- Project is already in excellent shape
- Minimal changes needed
- Focus will be on documentation and removing redundancy
