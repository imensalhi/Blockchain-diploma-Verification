- Basic knowledge of Ethereum, Solidity, and JavaScript

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Blockchain-diploma-Verification.git
   cd Blockchain-diploma-Verification
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Start Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start blockchain
   npm run node
   
   # Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
   npm run deploy:local
   
   # Terminal 3: Start frontend
   npm run frontend:serve
   ```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- Use Solidity ^0.8.24
- Follow [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/) security practices
- Include comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Optimize for gas efficiency
- Include security considerations in comments

**Example:**
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Issue a new diploma with comprehensive validation
 * @param diplomaHash Keccak256 hash of the diploma PDF
 * @param universityName Name of the issuing university
 * @param degreeType Type of degree being issued
 * @notice Only authorized universities can issue diplomas
 * @return success Whether the diploma was successfully issued
 */
function issueDiploma(
    bytes32 diplomaHash,
    string memory universityName,
    bytes32 degreeType
) external returns (bool success) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

#### JavaScript/Frontend
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Handle errors gracefully
- Optimize for performance and user experience

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate Keccak-256 hash of uploaded file
 * @param {File} file - The uploaded PDF file
 * @returns {Promise<string>} The hex-encoded hash
 */
async function calculateFileHash(file) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Smart Contract Tests
- Use Hardhat with Chai assertions
- Test all public functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test access control and security features
- Aim for 100% code coverage

**Example test structure:**
```javascript
describe("DiplomaRegistry", function () {
    describe("Diploma Issuance", function () {
        it("Should allow authorized university to issue diploma", async function () {
            // Test implementation
        });
        
        it("Should reject diploma from unauthorized university", async function () {
            // Test implementation
        });
        
        it("Should emit DiplomaIssued event", async function () {
            // Test implementation
        });
    });
});
```

#### Frontend Testing
- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Verify MetaMask integration
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Ensure responsive design works on multiple devices

### Git Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write code following style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Commit Messages**
   Use conventional commit format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add diploma revocation functionality"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve MetaMask connection issue"
   git commit -m "docs: update deployment instructions"
   git commit -m "test: add edge cases for verification"
   ```

4. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure CI/CD checks pass

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Smart Contract Security
- Never introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Use access control modifiers appropriately
- Emit events for all state changes
- Consider gas limit implications
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Frontend Security
- Never expose private keys or sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle MetaMask disconnections gracefully
- Use HTTPS in production
- Sanitize any user-generated content

### Testing Security
- Test with malicious inputs
- Verify access control restrictions
- Test boundary conditions
- Simulate network failures
- Test with edge case gas limits

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Include comprehensive README files
- Document all public APIs
- Provide usage examples
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### Pull Request Documentation
- Clear description of changes
- List of testing performed
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Breaking changes noted
- Security implications considered
